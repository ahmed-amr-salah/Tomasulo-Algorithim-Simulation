# About The Project: 
This project is an educational mobile application which simulates the performance of a simplified out-of-order execution RISC processor that implements Tomasulo's algorithm without speculation.
The supported instructions are LOAD, STORE, ADD/ADDI, SLL, NEG, and NAND. The application takes the program as input from the user and displays the instructions' table showing each instruction's issued, executed, and write back cycles as output. Additionally, it displays a table showing the readiness of each register and each register's producing unit. It also displays the total execution time as the number of cycles elapsed, IPC, and branch misprediction percentage.
The application verifies the user's input to ensure that the given program includes supported instructions with their correct formats.
